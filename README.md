# 2D_projectile

**Overview**

This is a Python program to simulate and animate the motion of a 2D projectile (without air resistance). Run the '2D_projectile.py' file and
adjust the input parameters (initial projection velocity, projection angle, initial x and y coordinates) to get a '2d_projectile.gif' output.

**Theory and Formulae Used**

A particle being projected at a velocity $u$ at an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, moves in a parabolic trajectory under the influence of gravity (in the absence of air resistance). We can break down the velocity $\mathbf{v}$ of the particle at any point in the trajectory into two components along the $X$ and $Y$ axes.

$$

\mathbf{v} = {v_{x}}\hat{i} + {v_{y}}\hat{j}

$$
